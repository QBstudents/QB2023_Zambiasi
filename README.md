I'm originally from Spring Lake, Michigan and did my undergrad degree at Michigan State University from 2017-2021. I majored in Plant Biology (after switching twice!) and minored in Spanish. I also played trumpet in the Spartan Marching Band and Spartan Brass. I'm in the Lau Lab here at Indiana and am interested in plant community ecology and effects of climate change and dominant species on community stability. One surprising fact about me is that at the time of writing (1/13/23), the only national park I've ever been to is the Cinque Terre in Italy. A few expectations for this course would be:
-Expanding my skills with data visualization
-Become familiar enough with GitHub/Git that I can start using it for my own projects
-Learn specific techniques for working with data related to questions of biodiversity (which I expect will come up in my own research work in the future!)
-Keep up on my work! Some of my other courses this semester have some pretty lengthy weekly assignments so I want to make sure I'm balancing everything well.
